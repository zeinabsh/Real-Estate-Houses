# Real-Estate-Houses
 I analyzed the U.S. real estate market, bringing together insights from construction activity, housing prices, and macroeconomic indicators.

The dataset includes time-series data from 2000 to 2023, covering key metrics like building permits, home price index, GDP, mortgage rates, unemployment, and more—allowing a deep dive into market behavior and economic relationships.


🧩 Project Highlights:

Tracking the number of housing units built and permitted over time.

Monitoring the Home Price Index and total construction spending.

Visualizing interest and mortgage rates.

Exploring unemployment, urban income, and population trends.

🔍 Key Insights:

✅There’s a strong correlation between building permits and actual construction, reflecting consistent project execution and planning.

✅ Delinquency rates dropped, while mortgage interest rates stabilized—indicating improved credit conditions.

✅ Home Price Index has shown consistent growth since 2015, driven by demand and supply shifts.

✅ Strong correlations were found between housing sales volume, income levels, and unemployment rate.

✅ Using Forecasting models, I was able to predict future trends assuming stable economic factors.

Key Metrics:

Avg HPI: 180.7

Avg GDP: 18.1K

Total Construction Spending: 77.90 (summed value)

Visuals & Insights:

📉 GDP (Gross Domestic Product): A key driver of long-term real estate trends. Home prices tend to rise as GDP grows

🏗️ Construction Spending: Higher spending suggests increased development and correlates positively with housing prices.

📊 Home Price Index (HPI):Consistent upward trend post-2015. Influenced by supply-demand dynamics, income, and broader economic stability.

📉There is an inverse relationship between mortgage/interest rates and home prices—lower rates often stimulate higher prices.


📌 Key Recommendations:
🏗️ Streamline construction processes to meet housing demand efficiently.

📉 Monitor interest and mortgage rates to support housing affordability.

📈 Focus investments in areas with strong income growth and low unemployment.

💳 Promote financial readiness to maintain low delinquency rates.

🔮 Use forecasting tools for better planning and decision-making.
